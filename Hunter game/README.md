Hunter Game
=====

 Game given to us as an assignment during the first year.
 It is comand line game withouth any graphics.
 
 The idea of the game is that:
 You are in a 10 by 10 field and you have to evade the hunters.
 There are 2 levels of the game and the second kicks in after
 you have reach a certain amount of score.
 
 The high scores are writen and read in a '.txt' file so they are
 not lost when you start the game later.
